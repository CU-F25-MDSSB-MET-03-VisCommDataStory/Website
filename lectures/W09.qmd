## Terminology

|             | Definition      | Where?
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------
| [**Insight**]{style="color:darkgreen"} | (unexpected) *shift* in the way one understands things | In the audiences mind 
| [**Story Point**]{style="color:darkblue"}  | A part of a narrative. Something you communicate in words. Bringing across an [insight]{style="color:darkgreen"} needs at least one [story point]{style="color:darkblue"}, maybe more building on each other. | In your narrative script for the presentation
| [**Data Visual**]{style="color:darkorange"}      | A graphical representation of data. In *data storytelling* most [story points]{style="color:darkblue"} center around one or more visuals. | On a slide in your slidedeck and/or in a Figure in your report
| [**Conceptual Visual**]{style="color:purple"} | A visual that is not based on data, but helps to explain [story points]{style="color:darkblue"} about concepts, ideas, and processes. In *visual communication* also non-data story points use visuals. | On a slide in your slidedeck and/or in a Figure in your report

::: {.incremental}
- Think about communicating **Totals**, **Percentages** and **Variance**. How important is which for your story?  
- Do you need a Special Calculated Metric? 
- What added context will help? (Aggregated data as main trend, or data from other sources for comparison.)
