## Visual Communication $\to$ Tell a story

## Why do we need to tell a story?

::: {.incremental}
- Most data visualization is done for the purpose of communication. 
- We have insights from data, and we have a potential audience for it. 
- To communicate successfully, we have to present a clear and exciting story. 
- [The need for a story may seem disturbing to scientists and engineers, who may equate it with making things up, putting a spin on things, or overselling results.]{style='color:blue;'}
- This perspective misses the important role that stories play in reasoning and memory!
- Moreover, any communication creates a story in the audience’s minds. If we don’t provide a clear story ourselves, then our audience will make one up. In the best-case scenario, the story they make up is reasonably close to our own view of the material presented. However, it can be and often is much worse. The made-up story could be “this is boring,” “the author is wrong,” or “the author is incompetent.

. . .

So, we have to do it, even we tend to not wanting to do it...

## Data, Visuals, [Narrative]{style='color:blue;'} {.smaller}


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='33%'}
The three essential elements of data stories.

![](img/dykes/datanarrativesvisuals.png)

:::

::: {.column width='65%'}
- [**Explain.**]{style='color:blue;'} Narrative coupled with data. 
  - What's happening in the data? 
  - What is the context?
  - Guide through the data structure!
  - Why is a particular insight important? 
- **Enlighten.** Visuals applied to data. 
  - Some insights are hard with numbers only. 
  - Show patterns and outliers otherwise hidden. 
- [**Engage.**]{style='color:blue;'} Narrative and visuals merged together. 
  - Engage (or even entertain) an audience. 
  - Visuals capture interest, only a story holds attention.

## Data Story Continuum {.smaller}

![](img/dykes/datastorycontinuum.png)

[With Data Storytelling you typically tend towards the *right hand* side.]{style='color:red;'}

## Storyframing {.smaller}

- Before you communicate insight, you must find one!
- Focus on key dimensions and find key metrics

## Anatomy of a Data Story {.smaller}

## Your Storytelling Project {.smaller}

You will tell the story in both formats with a focus on the *Narrative Structure*.


![](img/dykes/storyformat.png){width="40%"}

. . . 

Your report will have two parts: 

1. [**Slide deck and presentation**]{style='color:blue;'}: Narrative structure
2. [Classical **Report** as classical HTML page]{style='color:blue;'}: Inverted pyramid structure

## Six essential elements of data stories {.smaller}

![](img/dykes/datastories_six_elements.png)

- [Your **project slide deck and presentation** matches a **Data Presentation**]{style='color:blue;'}
- [Your **project  report** matches a **Curated Report (and Dashboard)**]{style='color:blue;'}

## Differences in Communication {.smaller}

![](img/dykes/direct_vs_indirect_comm.png)

- [Your **project slide deck and presentation** is direct communication]{style='color:blue;'}
- [Your **project  report** is indirect communication]{style='color:blue;'}

## Storyboarding {.smaller}

- Definition: A **story** is an account of causally related or connected series of events.
- A narrative always has a one-dimensional **linear sequence**, but we can decide 
  - what is in and 
  - in which order.
- **Storyboarding** is a technique from the movie industry (invented at Disney's in the 30's, now part of pre-visualization) which can also be used for data presentations. 
- Main purpose: [**Build the story, not the exact visualizations (rough ideas are enough)!**]{style='color:blue;'}

**A storyboard is Milestone 4**
