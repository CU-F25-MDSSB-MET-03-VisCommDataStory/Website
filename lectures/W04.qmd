# Relationships - Snippet on Spurious Correlations

## Stop eating margarine!

![](img/spuriouscorrelation_margerine.png)

. . .

From Tyler Vigen's famous [Spurious Correlations](https://tylervigen.com/spurious/correlation/7036_popularity-of-the-distracted-boyfriend-meme_correlates-with_the-number-of-statisticians-in-new-jersey)

Recall: What does $p < 0.05$ mean? 

. . . 

If there was actually real no effect, you would see data this extreme only 5% of the time.

## Dual y-axes give several options!

- You choose where each y-axes starts and stops, which means ...   
    ... you can force the two trends to line up in many different ways.

. . .

- Only do it if the two axes are really measuring the same thing!
- Or if you can provide a **convincing reason** why the different y-axis should be related in the way you do it

. . .

Alternatives:  

- Use facets
- Use other aesthetics (color, shape, size)

<!-- ## Visualize Correlation

$$
r_{x, y} = \frac{\operatorname{cov}(x, y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
$$

Meaning: As the value of X goes up, Y tends to go up (or down)
.box-1[Says nothing about *how much*<br>Y changes when X changes
